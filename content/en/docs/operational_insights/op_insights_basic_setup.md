description: Configure a basic setup for Operational Insights to test Elasticsearch in a single instance.
---

This section explains the individual components of Amplify Analytics Operational Insights (AAOI) and how they can be deployed and work together. This is a fully functional configuration to get you started as quickly as possible, and which allows you to try out AAOI to gain experience and be prepared for the deployment in your production environment.

{{< alert title="Note">}}This configuration is recommended for development environments.{{< /alert >}}

After completing the basic setup you will have a single node Elasticsearch instance including multiple Kibana dashboards. You can also import and use the sample Kibana dashboards or create your own visualizations.

At this point, API Gateway Manager is not yet configured, therefore this single instance receives data from 1-to-many API Gateways via Filebeat, Logstash, and API Builder, and is accessible via the Traffic Monitor.

This basic setup uses minimal parameters to run and test AAOI on a machine with at least 16 GB of RAM, including the API Management Platform. Therefore, this setup does not suit a production environment without further configuration.

For a production environment, check the parameters mentioned in the `env-sample` file provided and set them if necessary.

You can deploy AAOI using Docker Compose or Helm charts. The following sections cover the common setup for both Helm and Docker Compose options.

## Architecture example

The following image shows the overall architecture of the Elasticsearch components running with API Gateway Manager:

![ELK architecture](/Images/op_insights/op_insights_DockerComposeArchitecture.png)

This architecture makes it possible to collect data from API Gateway instances into a centralized Elasticsearch instance to have the data available with the best possible performance, independent of the network performance.

It also helps with data persistency when running API Gateway in a Docker environment where containers are started and stopped, as it avoids the loss of data when an API Gateway container is stopped.

## Enable Open Traffic Event Log

You must enable [Open Traffic Event Log](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/admin_open_logging/#configure-open-traffic-event-logging) for your API Gateway instances to allow your log files to be created by default at `apigateway/logs/opentraffic`. This location is required for when configuring Filebeat later.

To avoid data loss from your API Gateway instance, it is strongly recommended to increase the disk space for the Open Traffic logs from 1 GB to at least 8 GB, particularly if you have a lot of traffic in your API Gateway instance. For example, if Filebeat and Logstash are not running to process events for any period of time, data might be lost because of logging and data policies.

## Install Kibana dashboards

To install Kibana dashboards, use the Kibana Menu **Stack Management > Saved Objects > Import saved objects** and select the following file from the release package, `kibana/dashboards/7/*.ndjson`.

On the **Import options** window, select **Automatically overwrite conflicts**. This is the default setting, and you must always select it regardless of whether you are installing the dashboards for the first time or after an update.

You can create customized visualizations and dashboards, but do not change the ones that come by default because they will be overwritten with the next update. Customized visualizations and dashboards are not changed by the import action.

## Setup Admin Node Manager

Configure Admin Node Manager (ANM) to render log data provided by Elasticsearch instead of the individual API Gateway instances. The ANM API listens to port `8090` for administrative traffic by default, and it is responsible for serving the Traffic Monitor.

To configure the node manager to render log data from Elasticsearch, follow these steps:

1. Open the node manager configuration in Policy Studio. For more information, see [Authentication and RBAC with Active Directory](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/general_rbac_ad_ldap/#use-the-ldap-policy-to-protect-management-services).
2. Import the provided policy fragment (`nodemanager/policy-use-elasticsearch-api-7.7.0.xml`) from the release package you have downloaded. This imports the policy, **Use Elasticsearch API**.
3. Update the **Protect Management Interfaces** policy by inserting the **Use Elasticsearch API** policy as a callback policy (see filter, **Shortcut filter**) into the main policy, and wire it like shown in the following image.
    ![Admin Node Manager Protect Management Interfaces ](/Images/op_insights/op_insights_node_manager_policies_use_es_api.png)
4. Disable the audit log for **Failure** transactions to avoid unnecessary log messages in the node manager trace file.
    ![Disable audit log for Failure transactions ](/Images/op_insights/op_insights_policy_shortcut_disable_failure.png)
5. Configure your ANM with your Certificate Authority (CA) in the form of a `.p12` file to ensure the ANM can communicate with API Builder (See [custom certificates](#custom-certificates) for details on how to generate the certificate-key pair). Import the CA into Policy Studio as follows:

    * Navigate to **Environment Configuration > Certificates and Keys > Certificates**.
    * Click **Create/Import > Import Certificate + Key**, then search and select your `CA.p12` file.
    * Click **Use Subject for the Alias Name**, then click **OK**.

6. Navigate to the **Use Elasticsearch API** policy to configure the request to the Elasticsearch API to use the imported CA:

    * Double click **Connect to Elasticsearch API** and navigate to the **SSL** tab.
    * In the **Trusted Certificates** tab, select the certificate that you have imported.
    * Click **Finish**.

        ![Connect Elasticsearch tick CA](/Images/op_insights/op_insights_node_manager_connect_elasticsearch_ca.png)

7. If running API Builder locally on ANM, open the `<apigateway-install-dir>/apigateway/conf/envSettings.props` file and add the `env.API_BUILDER_URL` environment variable to point towards the API Builder URL. For example, `env.API_BUILDER_URL=https://localhost:8443`.

8. Add the `env.AAOI_RAISE_ELASTICSEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_ERROR` environment variable to the `<apigateway-install-dir>/apigateway/conf/envSettings.props` file to return an error message for API Gateway non-admin users when apibuilder4elastic is unavailable. For example, `env.AAOI_RAISE_ELASTICSEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_ERROR=true`. If the environment variable is false or not provided, the Elasticserach API policy retrieves the traffic from OpsDB as usual when apibuilder4elastic is down.

9. If you are using [multiple regions](/docs/operational_insights/additional_features/op_insights_multiple_apimanagers/#configure-different-topologies-and-domains), you must configure the appropriate region to restrict the data of node manager to the correct regional data, for example, `env.REGION=US`.
10. Copy the new configuration from the Policy Studio project folder (path on Linux, `/home/<user>/apiprojects/<project-name>`) back to the ANM folder (`<install-dir>/apigateway/conf/fed`).
11. Restart the Admin Node Manager.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}An alternative to using the provided policy fragment, `nodemanager/policy-use-elasticsearch-api-7.7.0.xml`, is to [manually configure the Admin Node Manager Policy](/docs/operational_insights/additional_features/op_insights_configure_anm). {{< /alert >}}

### Configure Admin Node Manager per region

If you use AAOI with multiple regions and different domains, all events and documents are stored in one single Elasticsearch. Therefore, you also need to tell the Admin Node Manager (ANM) in each region, which data (indices) to use. If you fail to do that, the ANM will show the entire traffic from all regions, which might not be desired.

To indicate to the node manager which data to use, store the appropriate region, which is also specified in the Filebeats for the API gateways, in the `conf/envSettings.props` file and restart the node manager. For example:

``` none
env.REGION=US
```

By doing this, ANM will only select data from these regional indexes. To learn more about the region parameter and multiple API Managers, see [Multiple API Managers](/docs/operational_insights/additional_features/op_insights_multiple_apimanagers/).

## Traffic Monitor view for API Manager users

In larger companies, hundreds of API service providers use API Manager to register their own services and APIs. While the service providers require access to the Traffic Monitor to monitor their own APIs independently, during registration, the corresponding APIs are assigned to API Manager organizations, which logically split them up. However, the standard traffic monitor does not restrict the view for a user based on the organization of an API.

AAOI solves this problem by storing the API transactions in Elasticsearch with the appropriate organization. The API organization is used when reading the traffic data from Elasticsearch, based on the following table.

| API Gateway Manager | API Manager | Restriction                       | Comment     |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Administrator       | N/A         | Unrestricted access               | A Gateway Manager user is considered as an Admin when they own the permission, `adminusers_modify`.  |
| Operator            | API Admin   | All APIs having a service context | By default, each API processed by the API Manager has a [Service context](/docs/apim_reference/open_logging_schema/#service-context). Pure API Gateway APIs, for example, `. /healthcheck`, will not be visible. |
| Operator            | Org Admin   | APIs of its own organization      | This user only sees the APIs that belong to the same organization as himself.  |
| Operator            | User        | APIs of its own organization      | The same rules apply as for the Org Admin.           |

### Setup API Manager user in API Gateway Manager

To restrict access to the API Gateway Traffic Monitor based on the API Manager user, the user must be configured in the API Gateway Manager with the same login name as in the API Manager. By default, all API Gateway Traffic Monitor users have **unrestricted** access if one of their roles includes the `adminusers_modify` permission. All other users have a restricted view of the API traffic.

To set up or change the user authorization, you must configure it in the `UNRESTRICTED_PERMISSIONS` parameter, located in your `.env` file.

## Setup with Helm

To set up Operational Insights with Helm, see [setup Operational insights in your production environment](/docs/operational_insights/production_setup/op_insights_setup_prod_helm).

## Basic setup with Docker Compose

The following sections cover the configuration specific to using Docker Compose.

1. Pull down the latest APIBuilder4Elastic image from the [Axway repository](https://repository.axway.com/catalog?artifactType=DockerImage&q=apibuilder4elastic).
2. Download the corresponding `.tgz` configuration files from the [Axway repository](https://repository.axway.com/catalog?q=AAOI&artifactType=Package).
3. Extract the `.tgz` file and change directory into the top level directory `apim4elastic`.
4. Configure the image to be used in your configuration files by changing the `image` parameter inside of the `docker-compose.yaml`.

To simplify updates, it is recommended to create a symlink folder and rename the provided `env-sample` file to `.env` in each machine as in the following example:

```bash
ln -s axway-apim-elk-v5.3.0 apim4elastic
cd axway-apim-elk-v5.3.0
cp env-sample .env
```

We recommend that you store your `.env` file as a central configuration file in a version management system.

### Custom certificates

If an existing Elasticsearch cluster is already deployed, provide the required CA to allow certificate validation. Otherwise, a certificate must be created for each component. The script `config/certificates/quickgen_certs_and_keys.sh` creates the corresponding certificates and keys in the `config/certificates` folder. Afterwards, these certificates must be configured in the `.env` file:

```bash
API_BUILDER_SSL_KEY=config/certificates/apibuilder4elastic.key
API_BUILDER_SSL_CERT=config/certificates/apibuilder4elastic.crt
API_BUILDER_SSL_KEY_PASSWORD=<YOUR_SSL_KEY_PASSWORD>
ELASTICSEARCH_CA=config/certificates/ca.crt
ELASTICSEARCH_KEY=config/certificates/elasticsearch1.key
ELASTICSEARCH_CRT=config/certificates/elasticsearch1.crt
KIBANA_KEY=config/certificates/kibana.key
KIBANA_CRT=config/certificates/kibana.crt
```

{{< alert title="Note">}}The `quickgen_certs_and_keys.sh` script is meant for a quick setup and development environments only, and is not fit for a production environment.{{< /alert >}}

### Setup Elasticsearch

If you are using an existing Elasticsearch cluster, you can skip this section and jump to the [Logstash, Memcached and APIBuilder4Elastic](#setup-logstash-memcached-and-apibuilder4elastic) section.

To setup Elasticsearch, open your `.env` file and configure the `ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS` parameter in a single Elasticsearch node. You can start with a single node and add more nodes later. This parameter is used by all Elasticsearch clients (Logstash, API Builder, Filebeat) to establish communication. If you are using an external Elasticsearch cluster, specify your nodes instead. Note that the hostnames must be resolvable within the Docker containers.

You must change the following parameters before starting the cluster:

```bash
ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=https://my-elasticsearch-host.com:9200
ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTERNAME=axway-apim-elasticsearch-prod
ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms8g -Xmx8g"
```

Run the following command to initialize a new Elasticsearch cluster, which runs the appropriate bootstrapping. Later, you can add more nodes to this single node cluster. Do not use the `init` extension when restarting the node:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env -f elasticsearch/docker-compose.es01.yml -f elasticsearch/docker-compose.es01init.yml up -d
```

Wait until the cluster has started, then call the following URL:

```bash
curl -k GET https://my-elasticsearch-host.com:9200
```

Result:

```bash
{
  "name" : "elasticsearch1",
  "cluster_name" : "axway-apim-elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "nCFt9WhpQr6JSOVY_h48gg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.16.1",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "docker",
    "build_hash" : "d34da0ea4a966c4e49417f2da2f244e3e97b4e6e",
    "build_date" : "2020-09-23T00:45:33.626720Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.6.2",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

At this point, you can add the cluster UUID (ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_UUID) to the `.env` file to get the single-node Elasticsearch cluster up and running.

### Setup Kibana

If you are using an existing Elasticsearch cluster, you can skip this section and jump to [Logstash, Memcached and APIBuilder4Elastic](#setup-logstash-memcached-and-apibuilder4elastic) section.

All required parameters for Kibana are set by default in your `.env` file. Start Kibana with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env -f kibana/docker-compose.kibana.yml up -d
```

If running Kibana locally, access it by way of the following link:

```none
https://localhost:5601
```

If Kibana does not start (it might take 3-4 minutes) or it does not load correctly, run the `docker logs kibana` command to open the log and examine the running container.

### Setup Logstash, Memcached, and APIBuilder4Elastic

It is recommended to deploy Logstash, Memcached, and APIBuilder4Elastic components on a single machine first, so they are in a common Docker Compose file and share the same network. Furthermore, low latency between these components is beneficial. The default values for Logstash, Memcached, and API Builder in your `.env` file are set up with the assumption that these components are running on the same machine.

Use the following parameter to specify where the Admin Node Manager or the API Manager can be found:

```bash
ADMIN_NODE_MANAGER=https://my-admin-node-manager:8090
```

 If not using the default API Manager admin user and password, use the following parameters to specify the API Manager admin user details:

```bash
API_MANAGER_USERNAME=elkAdmin
API_MANAGER_PASSWORD=elastic
```

If you are using an existing Elasticsearch cluster and have therefore skipped sections [Setup Elasticsearch](#setup-elasticsearch) and [Setup Kibana](#setup-kibana), you must now configure the Elasticsearch hosts, [any necessary users](/docs/operational_insights/production_setup/op_insights_setup_prod_docker/#activate-user-authentication), and the [Elasticsearch server certificates](#custom-certificates) as follows:

```bash
ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=https://my-existing-elasticsearch-host1.com:9200, https://my-existing-elasticsearch-host2.com:9200, https://my-existing-elasticsearch-host3.com:9200
```

Use the the main Docker Compose file to start all three components:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Check that the docker containers for Logstash, API Builder, and Memached are running.

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-61-59 axway-apim-elk-v5.3.0]$ docker ps
```

Result:

```none
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                              NAMES

d672f2983c86        memcached:1.6.6-alpine                      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   4 hours ago         Up 4 hours             11211/tcp                          memcached
```

It might take some time (2-3 minutes) until Logstash is finally started. You should expect to see the following when examining the Logstash logs:

```none
docker logs logstash
Pipelines running {:count=>6, :running_pipelines=>[:".monitoring-logstash", :BeatsInput, :Events, :DomainAudit, :TraceMessages, :OpenTraffic], :non_running_pipelines=>[]}
Successfully started Logstash API endpoint {:port=>9600}
```

* The Logstash API endpoint (`9600`) is not exposed outside the Docker container.
* Logstash is configured not to create indexes or index templates in Elasticsearch. These will be handled later on by API Builder when the first events are received. This is because they might need to be created accordingly to the region specified in the configuration file.

### Setup Filebeat

Filebeat must be configured and started to begin reading and sending your gateway's logging data. You can start Filebeat as a Docker container using the Docker Compose files and mount the corresponding directories into the container. Alternatively, you can install Filebeat natively on the API gateway and configure it accordingly. For that, you must use the `filebeat/filebeat.yml` file as a base configuration file. This file contains instructions that control the logstash pipelines.

Add the following to your configuration. At this point you can already configure the Filebeat instances with a name and region if you like. The following instructions assume that you set up Filebeat based on `filebeat/docker-compose.filebeat.yml`.

```bash
APIGATEWAY_LOGS_FOLDER=/opt/Axway/APIM/apigateway/logs/opentraffic
APIGATEWAY_TRACES_FOLDER=/opt/Axway/APIM/apigateway/groups/group-2/instance-1/trace
APIGATEWAY_EVENTS_FOLDER=/home/localuser/Axway-x.y.z/apigateway/events
APIGATEWAY_AUDITLOGS_FOLDER=/home/localuser/Axway-x.y.z/apigateway/logs
GATEWAY_NAME=API-Gateway 3
GATEWAY_REGION=US
```

Audit logs are optional. If you do not wish them indexed, just point them to an invalid folder. You can find more information about each parameter in the `env-sample`.

To start the Filebeat container, run:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f filebeat/docker-compose.filebeat.yml up -d
```

Use `docker logs filebeat` to check the health of the container and that no errors are displayed. You can examine the indexes in Kibana (**Menu > Management > Stack Management > Index Management**) to check whether the indexes are filled with data. If you encounter any issues, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/operational_insights/op_insights_troubleshooting_tips).

### Where to go next

After you have set up Operational Insights in a single node Elasticsearch scenario, you can proceed to [set up in your production environment](/docs/operational_insights/production_setup).
