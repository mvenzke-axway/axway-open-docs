description: Prerequisites to configure Operational Insights in API Gateway.
---

Deploying Operational Insights requires knowledge of the Axway [API Management solution](/docs/api_mgmt_overview/api_mgmt_components/), basic understanding of Docker, and a solid understanding of [HTTPS and server certificates](https://www.ssl.com/article/browsers-and-certificate-validation/) and how to validate them via trusted CAs.

You have two options to deploy Operational Insights:

* On a container orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, by using the provided Helm charts.
* On servers or virtual machines (VMs) with Docker installed, by using Docker Compose.

This page covers the prerequisites for both options.

## General prerequisites

The following prerequisites are common for all types of deployment.

### Elastic stack

Operational Insights is based on the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/). It can run completely in Docker containers, which for example are started on the basis of `docker-compose.yaml` files or in a Docker Orchestration framework.

It is also possible to use existing components, such as an Elasticsearch cluster or a Kibana instance, to avail of the flexibility of using, for instance, an Elasticsearch service at AWS or Azure, or use Filebeat manually installed on the API Gateway machines.

### API Gateway and API Manager

Operational Insights is designed to work with classic and container API Management deployment models, and it is mainly based on events given in the [Open Traffic Event Log](/docs/apim_reference/monitor_traffic_events_metrics/#open-traffic-event-log-settings), therefore, you must ensure that this setting is enabled.

### Configure traffic payload

The payload part of an API request is not written directly to the open traffic event log and therefore, it is not stored in Elasticsearch by default.

The following is an example of what a payload looks like:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date:Wed, 13 Jan 2021 23:08:58GMT
CSRF-Token:62325BA818F8203917CB61AE883346D7F7A206E564E26008CAC3ED37386B1B7B

```

The following sections describe how to configure the payload to be persisted in Elasticsearch.

### Configure payload export

Export the payload from API Gateway to make it available in the Traffic Monitor.

1. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Server Settings** > **Logging** > **Open Traffic Event Log**.
2. Select **Enable Open Traffic Event Log**.
3. Specify the required settings (for example, directory, maximum disk space, and so on).
4. Under **Payload Settings**, select **Use filesystem** (change the **Filesystem directory** value if you wish).
5. Click **Save** at the bottom right.
6. Click **Deploy** in the toolbar to deploy your settings to API Gateway.

Repeat this procedure for each API Gateway group for which you want to make the payload available. You can change the **Filesystem directory** path if required, for example to write the payload to an NFS volume.

### Make the payload available

The saved payload must be made available to the API Builder Docker container as a mount under `/var/log/payloads`. You can find an example of this configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the shared volume key, for example, `${APIGATEWAY_PAYLOADS_FOLDER}:/var/log/payloads`.

Payload handling is enabled by default, so it is assumed that you provide the payload to the API Builder container. Set the parameter `PAYLOAD_HANDLING_ENABLED=false` in your `env` file if you do not need the payload information to be retrieved from Elasticsearch.

### Make the payload available per region

If you are using the **Region** feature, that is, collecting API Gateways of different Admin Node Manager domains into a central Elasticsearch instance, you must make the payload available to the API builder regionally separated. For example, if you have defined the region like, `REGION=US-DC1`, all traffic payload from these API Gateways must be made available to the API Builder as follows:

```bash
/var/log/payloads/us-dc1/<YYY-MM-DD>/<HH.MI>/<payloadfile>
```

You must make the existing structure available in a regional folder. For this, the region must be in lower case, and you must configure each Admin Node Manager with the correct region. For more information, see [Configure different topologies and domains](/docs/operational_insights/additional_features/op_insights_multiple_apimanagers).

{{< alert title="Note" >}}The payload shown in the Traffic Monitor UI is limited to 20 KB by default. If required, the full payload can be downloaded using the **Save** option while viewing the payload information in the Traffic Monitor.{{< /alert >}}

## Helm prerequisites

The following are the requirements specific to deploy Operational Insights on Docker Orchestration platforms using Helm charts.

* Kubernetes >= `1.19` (At least three dedicated worker nodes for three Elasticsearch instances).
* Helm >= `3.3.0`.
* `kubectl` installed and configured.
* [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) already installed.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
To access sample files referred throughout this section for user customizations, follow the instructions on the [Docker Compose](/docs/operational_insights/op_insights_basic_setup/#basic-setup-with-docker-compose) section to download the release package. {{< /alert >}}

### Kubernetes and OpenShift knowledge

Even though the Helm chart facilitates the deploy, extensive knowledge about these platforms and Helm is required:

* Concepts of Helm: How to create a Helm chart, installation, and upgrade.
* Kubernetes resources such as deployments, configMaps, and secrets.
* Kubernetes networking, Ingress, Services, and load balancing.
* Kubernetes volumes, persistent volumes, and volume mounts.

## Docker Compose prerequisites

The following are the requirements to deploy Operational Insights specifically using Docker Compose on physical servers or virtual machines (VMs) with Docker installed.

### Docker

Components, such as API Builder, run as a Docker container. The Elasticsearch stack is using standard Docker images, which are configured with environment variables and some mount points, allowing for great flexible where you can run them with the provided Docker Compose or with a Docker Orchestration platform (Kubernetes, OpenShift) to get elastic scaling and self-healing.

### Docker Compose

Your server or VMs must have Docker Compose installed and executable.

### Elastic stack for Docker Compose

If you are using an existing Elasticsearch environment including Kibana, the following requirements apply.

* Minimal Elasticsearch is version `7.10.x` with X-Pack enabled.
* Depending on the traffic, enough disk space available (it can be quite heavy depending on the traffic volume).

### Users and roles

The following table represents a suggestion of which roles should be created to work with Operational Insights, but you can configure the roles differently and assign them to the users accordingly.

| Role                 | Cluster privileges  | Index privileges   | Kibana    |
| :---                 | :---                | :---               | :---      |
| `axway_apigw_write`  | `monitor`          | `apigw-* - write`  | No         |
| `axway_apigw_read`   | `monitor`          | `apigw-* - read`   | No         |
| `axway_apigw_admin`  | `monitor`, `manage_ilm`, `manage_index_templates`, `manage_transform` | `apigw-* - monitor, view_index_metadata, create_index`, `apim-* - read,view_index_metadata`| Yes (All or Custom)  |
| `axway_kibana_write` | None               | None               | Yes (Analytics All)   |
| `axway_kibana_read`  | None               | None               | Yes (Analytics Read)     |

The following is an example of an Elasticsearch role configuration:

```json
POST /_security/role/axway_apigw_admin
{
  "cluster": ["monitor", "manage_ilm", "manage_index_templates", "manage_transform" ],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [ "apigw-*" ],
      "privileges": ["monitor", "view_index_metadata", "create_index" ]
    },
    {
      "names": [ "apm-*" ],
      "privileges": ["read", "view_index_metadata" ]
    }
  ],
  "applications" : [
      {
          "application" : "kibana-.kibana",
          "privileges" : [ "all" ],
          "resources" : [ "*" ]
      }
   ]
}
```

The following table assumes that the same user is also be used for stack monitoring. You can also split this into two users if necessary.

| Username                  | Roles                                                        | Comment                                                        |
| :---                      | :---                                                         | :---                                                           |
| `axway_logstash`            | `axway_apigw_write`, `logstash_system`                       | Parameter: `LOGSTASH_USERNAME` and `LOGSTASH_SYSTEM_USERNAME`  |
| `axway_apibuilder`          | `axway_apigw_read`, `axway_apigw_admin`                      | Parameter: `API_BUILDER_USERNAME`                              |
| `axway_filebeat`            | `beats_system`                                               | Parameter: `BEATS_SYSTEM_USERNAME`                             |
| `axway_kibana_read`         | `axway_apigw_read`, `axway_kibana_read`                      | Read only access to Dashboards                                 |
| `axway_kibana_write`        | `axway_apigw_read`, `axway_kibana_write`                     | Write access to dashboards, visualizations, and some other information such as ILM-Policies.                      |
| `axway_kibana_admin`        | `axway_apigw_read`, `axway_apigw_admin`, `axway_kibana_write`, `monitoring_user` | Access to Stack-Monitoring and APM         |

The following is an example of an Elasticsearch user configuration:

```json
POST /_security/user/axway_kibana_admin
{
   "password" : "changeme",
   "roles":[
      "axway_kibana_write",
      "monitoring_user",
      "axway_apigw_admin",
      "axway_apigw_read"
   ],
   "enabled":true
}
```

## Where to go next

After you ensure that you have all prerequisites in place, you can [setup a basic environment](/docs/operational_insights/op_insights_basic_setup/) to run tests in a development environment.
