}

This page lists all of the Axway-defined Java system properties, per version, from 7.5.3 up to the present, and it explains their purpose and the context in which they are employed.

* The properties can be found in the `JVM.xml` file.
* Note that because of fix ports, some properties might be duplicated among the three versions: 7.5.3, 7.6.2, and 7.7.

{{% alert title="Caution" color="warning" %}}
Do not change the system `jvm.xml` file located at `/apigateway/system/conf`. This file is replaced during both updates and upgrades, so any changes made to it will be lost. The `jvm.xml` file defines *include* points that allow you to add custom configuration, which will not be lost when this file is replaced.

## Update the JVM file extension to apply changes

You must update the `jvm.xml` file extension as follows:

* To apply settings to a single API Gateway instance, update the extension `jvm.xml` file located at `/apigateway/groups/[group X]/[instance Y]/conf`.
* To apply settings to all API Gateway instances on the local machine, update the extension `jvm.xml` file, located at `/apigateway/conf/`.

These files do not exist by default, so you must create them first. Both files require that all settings are wrapped in a single `<ConfigurationFragment>` tag, for example:

```xml
<ConfigurationFragment>
<!-- Your notes, e.g. a link to this page. -->
<VMArg name="-Dsome.property=some.value"/>
</ConfigurationFragment>
```

It is best practice to add XML comments as a reminder for what the setting does, and why the change in behavior is required.

## List of Java system properties by release

The following table lists the Java system properties that exist in the code and the release in which they were introduced.

|Release | System property                           | Context                                                        | Description  |
