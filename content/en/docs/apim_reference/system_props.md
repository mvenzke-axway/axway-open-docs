}

This page lists all of the Axway-defined Java system properties, per version, from 7.5.3 up to the present, and it explains their purpose and the context in which they are employed.

* The properties can be found in the `JVM.xml` file.
* Note that because of fix ports, some properties might be duplicated among the three versions: 7.5.3, 7.6.2, and 7.7.

{{< alert title="" color="danger">}}**Caution**</br>
Do not change the system `jvm.xml` file located at `/apigateway/system/conf`. This file is replaced during both updates and upgrades, so any changes made to it will be lost. The `jvm.xml` file defines *include* points that allow you to add custom configuration, which will not be lost when this file is replaced.
{{< /alert >}}

## Update the JVM file extension to apply changes

You must update the `jvm.xml` file extension as follows:

* To apply settings to a single API Gateway instance, update the extension `jvm.xml` file located at `/apigateway/groups/[group X]/[instance Y]/conf`.
* To apply settings to all API Gateway instances on the local machine, update the extension `jvm.xml` file, located at `/apigateway/conf/`.

These files do not exist by default, so you must create them first. Both files require that all settings are wrapped in a single `<ConfigurationFragment>` tag, for example:

```xml
<ConfigurationFragment>
<!-- Your notes, e.g. a link to this page. -->
<VMArg name="-Dsome.property=some.value"/>
</ConfigurationFragment>
```

It is best practice to add XML comments as a reminder for what the setting does, and why the change in behavior is required.

## List of Java system properties by release

The following table lists the Java system properties that exist in the code and the release in which they were introduced.

|Release | System property                           | Context                                                        | Description  |

|7.7 August 2023| com.axway.apimanager.configure.apis.nonblocking.enabled | API Manager | This property was introduced to the product in v7.7 November 2020, and it behaves differently as of this release. Previously, it allowed the API runtime cache (Virtualized API traffic brokers) and API Catalog to load in parallel, along with detaching the loading of these caches from the boot sequence (which applies to the gateway startup and deployment). Now, the API runtime cache, API Catalog, and API client cache always load in parallel. If set to `true`, this property detaches the loading of these three caches from the boot sequence, and allows the gateway to complete startup and deployment before they are loaded. API requests to value APIs (VAPI) Catalog and Virtualized APIs are held during their loading process, and only performed after they have finished loading. However, brokers will always be able to access the API client cache by default, even while it is loading or updating. Defaults to `false`. |
